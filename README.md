**Biniou** is a job scheduler that allows you to run commands and pipe them under various conditions. The jobs can be started on a schedule or based on events generated by other jobs.

The jobs can be defined based on the included templates or, for maximum flexibility, written in JavaScript. In that case you do any processing you want and dispatch the events in the format of your choice.

## Usage

- Install `biniou` globally, for example using `npm install -g @laurent22/biniou`
- You then need to let it run in the background, using `biniou start`

## Development

Run `yarn watch` to automatically build the application.

To run just one command, for testing, use:

```shell
yarn start run NAME_OF_JOB
```

`NAME_OF_JOB` will be the name of the folder in `~/.config/biniou/jobs`
